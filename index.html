Ingredients: <br>

For the Dough: <br>

2 cups all-purpose flour <br>

1/2 teaspoon salt <br>

Water, as needed <br>

For the Filling: <br>

1 pound ground chicken <br>

1 small onion, finely chopped <br>

2 cloves garlic, minced <br>

1-inch piece of ginger, minced <br>

2-3 green chilies, finely chopped (adjust to your spice preference) <br>

2 tablespoons cilantro, chopped <br>

1 teaspoon cumin powder <br>

1/2 teaspoon coriander powder <br>

Salt to taste <br>

Cooking oil <br>

For the Dipping Sauce: <br>

2-3 tablespoons soy sauce <br>

1-2 tablespoons vinegar (white or rice vinegar) <br>

1 teaspoon sesame oil (optional) <br>

1-2 cloves garlic, minced 

1/2 teaspoon red chili powder or chili flakes (adjust to your spice preference) <br>

Instructions: <br>

Prepare the Dough: <br>

In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. <br>

Gradually add water while kneading the mixture until you have a smooth, elastic dough. <br>

Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 30 minutes. <br>

Prepare the Filling: <br>

In a separate bowl, combine the ground chicken, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, minced ginger, chopped green chilies, 
cilantro, cumin powder, coriander powder, and salt. <br>

Mix everything thoroughly to create the filling. <br>

Assemble the Momo: <br>

Roll out the dough into small, thin circles (about 3-4 inches in diameter) using a rolling pin. <br>

Place a spoonful of the chicken filling in the center of each dough circle. <br>

Fold and Seal: <br>

Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape. <br>

Pinch the edges together to seal the momo. You can use various folding techniques for different shapes. <br>

Steam the Momo: <br>

Place the momo in a greased steamer, making sure they don't touch each other. <br>

Steam the momo for about 15-20 minutes or until the dough becomes translucent and the 
filling is cooked through. <br>

Prepare the Dipping Sauce: <br>

While the momo is steaming, prepare the dipping sauce by mixing soy sauce,
 vinegar, sesame oil (if using), minced garlic, and red chili powder or flakes.
 Adjust the seasoning to your taste. <br>

Serve: <br>

Once the momo is cooked, remove them from the steamer. <br>

Serve hot with the dipping sauce. <br>

Enjoy your homemade chicken momo! You can also make vegetarian
 momo by replacing the chicken filling with a mixture of vegetables, tofu, or paneer. <br>

                Ingredients:<br>

1 cup whole wheat flour (atta)<br>
1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
Water, as needed (about 1/2 cup)<br>
Oil for deep frying<br>
Instructions:<br>

Prepare the Dough:<br>

In a mixing bowl, combine the whole wheat flour and salt.<br>
Gradually add the vegetable oil and mix it into the flour.<br>
Start adding water little by little and knead the mixture to form a smooth,
 stiff dough. The dough should not be too soft.<br>
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.<br>
Divide the Dough:<br>

After resting, divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions. Roll them into smooth balls.<br>
Roll Out the Puri:<br>

Take one dough ball and flatten it slightly with your fingers.<br>
Using a rolling pin, roll it out into a thin, round disc. Aim for a thickness of about 3-4 inches.<br>
Heat the Oil:<br>

In a deep frying pan or a kadai, heat oil over medium-high heat. 
To check if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough 
into the oil; if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.<br>
Fry the Puri:<br>

Carefully slide one rolled-out puri into the hot oil.<br>
Gently press it with a slotted spoon to help it puff up. Be cautious, as the oil can be hot.<br>
Once the puri puffs up and turns golden brown on one side, flip it using the slotted spoon 
and fry until the other side is also golden brown.<br>
Remove and Drain:<br>

Using the slotted spoon, remove the fried puri from the hot oil and place it
 on a plate lined with paper towels to drain off excess oil.<br>
Repeat the Process:<br>

Continue rolling out and frying the remaining dough balls in the same manner.<br>
Serve:

Serve puri hot with your choice of curries, chutneys, or side dishes.<br>
Enjoy your homemade puri! They are best when served fresh and puffed up,
 so try to serve them immediately after frying.<br>

                Ingredients:<br>

1 cup red lentils (masoor dal), washed and rinsed<br>
3 cups water<br>
1 small onion, finely chopped<br>
2 cloves garlic, minced<br>
1-inch piece of ginger, minced<br>
1-2 green chilies, chopped (adjust to your spice preference)<br>
1 large tomato, chopped<br>
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
1 teaspoon cumin seeds<br>
1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds (optional)<br>
1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)<br>
1/2 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)<br>
1 teaspoon garam masala (Indian spice blend)<br>
1 teaspoon ground coriander<br>
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin<br>
Salt to taste<br>
2 tablespoons cooking oil<br>
Fresh cilantro leaves for garnish<br>
Lemon wedges (optional)<br>
Instructions:<br>

Rinse and Soak the Lentils:<br>

Wash the red lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.<br>
In a bowl, soak the lentils in enough water for about 15-20 minutes.
 This step is optional but helps in reducing the cooking time.<br>
Cook the Lentils:<br>

In a large saucepan, combine the soaked and drained lentils with 3 cups of water.<br>
Add turmeric powder and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.<br>
Reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes,
 or until the lentils are soft and mushy. You may need to add more water if the dal becomes too thick.<br>
Temper the Dal:<br>

In a separate small pan, heat the cooking oil over medium heat.<br>
Add the cumin seeds and, if using, mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds. Let them splutter and become fragrant.<br>
Add the asafoetida (hing) and stir for a few seconds.<br>
Sauté Aromatics:<br>

Add chopped onions, minced garlic, minced ginger, and green chilies to the tempered oil.<br>
Sauté until the onions become translucent and slightly browned.<br>
Add Tomatoes and Spices:<br>

Add the chopped tomatoes to the sautéed aromatics.<br>
Cook until the tomatoes become soft and start to break down.<br>
Add ground coriander, ground cumin, garam masala, and salt. Mix well.<br>
Combine the Tempering with Dal:<br>

Pour the tempered spice mixture into the cooked lentils.<br>
Stir well to combine all the ingredients.<br>
Simmer and Garnish:<br>

Allow the dal to simmer for another 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld together.<br>
Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot.<br>
Optional: Squeeze some lemon juice over the dal before serving for an extra burst of flavor.<br>

This masoor dal is delicious on its own or as a side dish with rice or Indian bread like naan or roti. Enjoy!<br>

Add the cumin seeds and allow them to splutter.<br>
Add the chopped onions, minced garlic, minced ginger, 
and green chilies. Sauté until the onions become soft and translucent.<br>

 ground coriander, garam masala, and red chili powder. 
 Cook the spices for a minute or two to release their flavors.<br>
Add Tomatoes:<br>

Add the chopped tomatoes or tomato puree to
 the pan. Cook until the tomatoes are soft and the oil begins
  to separate from the mixture. Stir occasionally.<br>
Cook the Chickpeas:<br>

Add the cooked chickpeas to the tomato mixture. Stir well to coat the chickpeas with the spices.<br>
Simmer:<br>

Add a cup of water to the chickpeas, and season with salt. Stir well.<br>
Simmer the mixture on low to medium heat for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the 
flavors to meld together. If the mixture becomes too dry, you can add a bit more water.<br>
